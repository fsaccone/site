Francesco Saccone's site content.

This repository contains all the content avaiable in my website, at
<https://francescosaccone.com>, and in my Gemini capsule, at
<gemini://francescosaccone.com>.

Usage
-----

All the pages are written in Markdown. You need to parse them to make them
avaiable when hosted with a protocol. I wrote all the scripts you need inside
the scripts/ directory:

- generate-html.sh: parse every Markdown page to HTML using lowdown.

- generate-gemini.sh: parse every Markdown page to Gemtext using lowdown.

- generate-sitemap.sh: Generate the sitemap.xml of the whole site.

- generate-atom.sh: Generate the atom.xml of blog/ with HTTP URLs.

The public/ directory and the robots.txt file should be statically hosted in
every protocol.

The favicon.ico file is only needed for HTTP, and can be ignored when hosting
any other protocol.
