Website
=======

Francesco Saccone's website content.

This repository contains all the content avaiable at
<https://francescosaccone.com>, as my website is fully static.

Structure
---------

All Markdown files (.md) are converted to HTML (.html) using md4c (see
<https://github.com/mity/md4c> for more information about the parser) and their
content is put between the content of footer.html and the content of
header.html.

Every file in public/, along with robots.txt and favicon.ico, is purely
statically hosted.
