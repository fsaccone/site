# Site

Francesco Saccone's site content.

This repository contains all the content avaiable in my website at
<https://francescosaccone.com>.

## Structure

All .md files represent a page.

The .md.time files are generated through the generatetime script: the first
line contains the timestamp of the creation of the respective .md file and the
second line contains the timestamp of the last modification of it. The
respective .md.time file of a .md file has to be regenerated every time the
.md file is modified, and this has to be part of an extra commit, right after
the one which modified the file. The only .md files that are excluded from this
process are 404.md and 5xx.md.
