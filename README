# Site

Francesco Saccone's site content.

This repository contains all the content avaiable in my website at
<https://francescosaccone.com> and in my Gemini capsule at
<gemini://francescosaccone.com>.

## Usage

All the pages are written in Markdown. Use the scripts inside the scripts/
directory to generate functional content:

- generate-html.sh: parse every Markdown page to HTML using lowdown.

- generate-gemini.sh: parse every Markdown page to Gemtext using lowdown.

- generate-sitemap.sh: Generate the sitemap.xml of the whole site.

- generate-atom.sh: Generate the atom.xml of blog/ with HTTP URLs.

The public/ directory should be statically hosted at /public.

The favicon.ico file should be available through HTTP at /favicon.ico.
